# MasterBigDataML-PythonCourse

This repository encompasses a comprehensive Python course, comprising both Python exercises and a final Python project.

## Folder Structure:

### 1. Python Exercises
   - In this section, you will find Python scripts addressing intricate problems using renowned libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn.

### 2. Python Project
   - The second folder focuses on a substantial project utilizing a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inductiveanks/employee-salaries-for-different-job-roles) concerning employee salaries and roles.
   - Throughout this project, we delve into fundamental Python structures, employing dictionaries, along with hands-on practice with Pandas dataframes, Matplotlib, and map-reduce techniques using mrjob.
   - Additionally, the project involves applying Scikit Learn to solve a simple linear regression problem, coupled with a basic exploratory analysis.
